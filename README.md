## Motivation

<table>
<tr>

Hello! Thanks for cheking out my repository! 


As an entry level web developer, I need all the practice I can get. I found I was overwhelmed by the pletheora of information out there that needed to be mastered. I was having a hard time developing a plan of attack to really propel my learning, and self growth. I have thus decided to create this repository, to give myself that extra push and motivation to learn and grow as a developer. 

Check back often for updates on what I've been working on. 
My goal is to have daily updates, as well as to experiment with as many coding languages as I can. Feedback is always appreciated.
