## Motivation

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Hello! Thanks for cheking out my repository! 


As an entry level web developer, I need all the practice I can get. I felt overwhelmed by all the material out there that needed to be mastered, as was having a hard time developing a plan of attack to really propel my learning, and growth as a web developer. I have thus decided to create this repository, to give myself that extra push and motivation to learn and grow as a developer. 

Check back often for updates. 
My goal is to update daily, as well as to play around with as many coding languages as I can. Feedback is always appreciated.
